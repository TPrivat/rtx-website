        <h1 class="info">What is a GPU?</h1>
        <p>The graphics processing unit is one of the main components of most modern personal computers. As the name suggests,
    this unit's main job is processing graphics, though this is by no means its only job. GPUs are also used to speed up
    applications requiring many matrix operations such as machine learning, video editing and video games.
    This multitasking is due to the advancement of the chips from a simple barrel shifter circuit to the full fledged
    processing units we see today. The need for graphics processing began in the 1970s with arcade games such as Space
    Invaders. The gaming industry has since been the main driver of GPU advancement. Today's GPUs are capable of 3D
    graphics acceleration and Nvidia has recently come out with ray tracing cores for improved lighting effects.
    These graphics cards are known as the RTX line. In recent years , there has been an increase in diversity of
    compute-intensive applications in modern cloud data centers.This continual increase in higher quality graphics has
    driven the explosion of GPU-accelerated cloud computing. Due to their high throughput a GPU can run thousands of
    concurrent threads and they achieve orders-of-magnitude speed-up over multi-core CPUs and are becoming popular for
    parallel and distributed computing applications.</p>
