  <h2>The Parallel Thread Execution ISA</h2>
  <h3>PTX</h3>

  <div>
    <p>A fundamental design issue of all modern processors has been how the instruction set architecture is designed. GPUs
    have become a popular platform for general purpose computing this is because of their massively parallel
    architectures which gives a high throughput and power efficiency. As GPUs evolve across different generations,
    their ISAs also evolve and it is intriguing to see how the ISA improves
    and how such evolution impacts the micro-architecture as well as overall performance. The Nvidia programming
    environment provides a parallel thread execution â€œPTX'' instruction set architecture for
    using the GPU as a data-parallel computing device. PTX instructions generally have from zero to four operands.
    plus an optional guard predicate appearing after an @ symbol to the left of the opcode:</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>@p opcode;</li>
      <li>@p opcode a;</li>
      <li>@p opcode d,a;</li>
      <li>@p opcode d, a, b;</li>
      <li>@p opcode d, a, b, c;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If a result is expected from the instructions, the d operand is the destination operand, while a, b, and c
        are source operands.
