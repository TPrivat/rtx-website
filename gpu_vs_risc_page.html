      RISC architectures are common in many central processing units. It uses a small set of highly optimized
      instructions based around memory access and ALU operations. The RISC architecture is designed to be a general
      purpose computing platform that executes instructions in series and achieves high instruction throughput. This
      design leads to a significant number of the transistors being devoted to caches and registers rather than pure
      computation.
      </p>
      <p>
      With graphics processing units the design focus is on computational ability. They are optimized for executing many
      parallel threads across multiple cores. These cores are quite simple when compared to the cores found in the central
      processing unit but because they are designed to work together, rather than separately like RISC, they have a much
      higher data throughput.
      </p>
      <p>
      These differences become apparent when looking at the design layout of each architecture. Central processing units
      have one datapath with its own L1 cache per core with a typical CPU having between four and eight cores. On the
      other hand the graphics processing unit has two or more data paths per core and many cores per L1 cache. A typical
      GPU can have many thousands of cores per card.
      </p>
      <p>
      Clearly the graphics processing unit is designed for its pure computational ability. It has more compute than the
      central processing unit but is specialized to graphics and arithmetic tasks and is not made for general computing
      like the central processing unit.
